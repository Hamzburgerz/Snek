how to run the Snake game:

When the game is opened you will gain control of a snake which can be controlled with the arrow keys.
It is your objective to 'eat' the most fruit possible without colliding the head of your snake to any parts of its body.
After the game is over, you will presented with a game over screen where you can see your statistics of gameplay over
